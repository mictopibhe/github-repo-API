# github-repo-API
A RESTful service built with **Java 21** and **Spring Boot 3.5**, designed to fetch all **non-forked public repositories** for a given GitHub user and return each repositoryâ€™s branches with their latest commit SHA. This project is developed under explicit constraints for a recruitment task.

## Features

- Returns public **non-fork** repositories for a given GitHub username
- Includes **branch list** and **last commit SHA** per branch
- Returns `404` with a custom message if the user does not exist
- Integrates with GitHub's REST API v3
- Includes **integration test** without mocks (using WireMock)
